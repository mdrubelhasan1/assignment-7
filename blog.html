            <p class="font-semibold text-2xl">Answer: An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. <br> <br>
                (a) Wait for Events: The event loop waits for events to occur. <br>

                (b) Dispatch Events: When an event occurs, the event loop dispatches it to the appropriate handler or callback function. <br>
                (c) Execute Callbacks: The handler or callback function associated with the event is executed. This is where the specific logic related to the event is implemented. <br>
                (d) Repeat: The event loop continues to wait for and dispatch events, repeating the process.
